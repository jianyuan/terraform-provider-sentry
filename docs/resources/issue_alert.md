  Sentry Issue Alert resource. Note that there's no public documentation for the values of conditions, filters, and actions. You can either inspect the request payload sent when creating or editing an issue alert on Sentry or inspect Sentry's rules registry in the source code https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/src/sentry/rules. Since v0.11.2, you should also omit the name property of each condition, filter, and action.

# sentry_issue_alert (Resource)

Sentry Issue Alert resource. Note that there's no public documentation for the values of conditions, filters, and actions. You can either inspect the request payload sent when creating or editing an issue alert on Sentry or inspect [Sentry's rules registry in the source code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/src/sentry/rules). Since v0.11.2, you should also omit the name property of each condition, filter, and action.
