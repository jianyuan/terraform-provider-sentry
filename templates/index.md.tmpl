# Sentry Provider

Terraform provider for [Sentry](https://sentry.io). The provider utilises the [Web APIs](https://docs.sentry.io/api/) to interact with Sentry resources:

**Organization**

- Manage [sentry_organization](resources/organization.md)
- Manage [sentry_team](resources/team.md)

**Project**

- Manage [sentry_project](resources/project.md)
- Manage client keys using [sentry_key](resources/key.md)

**Alerts and Dashboard**

- Manage [sentry_dashboard](resources/dashboard.md)
- Manage [sentry_issue_alert](resources/issue_alert.md)
- Manage [sentry_metric_alert](resources/metric_alert.md)

## Setup

### Authentication

You will need to configure the provider by providing an authentication token. You can create an authentication token within Sentry by [creating an internal integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration/#auth-tokens). This is also available for self-hosted Sentry.

```terraform
provider "sentry" {
  token = "my-auth-token"
}
```

It's best practice not to store the authentication token in plain text. As an alternative, the provider can source the authentication token from the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. If you choose to do this, you can omit the token variable from the configuration block above.

```terraform
provider "sentry" {}
```

### Self-hosted Sentry

If you are self-hosting Sentry, you can set the base URL here. The URL format must be in the format `https://[hostname]/api/`.

```terraform
# Configure the Sentry Provider
provider "sentry" {
  base_url = "https://example.com/api/"
}
```
